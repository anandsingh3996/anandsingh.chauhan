abstract: EV batteries have a significant energy storage potential that can be used in the demand side management and as the arbitrary storage. As most of the charging stations facilitate Grid-to-Vehicle(G2V) framework, this work aims to achieve Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) integration of an EV battery as well. The bidirectional charger of an EV supports the V2X (Vehicle-to-Grid, Vehicle-to-Home) feature, which can help in handling demand-side resources and can be used to reduce the peak demand of electricity in order to gain economic benefits. The DC-DC bidirectional converter and active front-end (DC-AC) converter with the detailed control methodology has been discussed in this paper. The DC-AC converter controls the power flow of the energy transmission of battery to the grid and vice versa and passive filter is used to reduce the harmonic distortion. Along with the maintenance of constant dc-link voltage, the DC-DC bidirectional converter adjusts current according to the control input given to the active front-end converter. The proposed model is simulated and tested in a real-time environment using OPAL-RT and the obtained results are as per the expectations.
