abstract: 'The energy sector is undergoing a massive transformation that includes key aspects such as integrating renewables, improving operational efficiency, leveraging smart grid infrastructure, and handling the dynamics of transactive energy. Digitization of electricity value chain and increased integration of distributed energy resources are turning passive consumers into active consumers who can locally sell their electricity, called Prosumers. The Peer to Peer (P2P) energy trading is a new paradigm, which introduces flexibility among the electricity users, where the energy from renewables and battery storage is shared and traded locally. 
We developed proof of concept (PoC) and test rig at IIT Gandhinagar to demonstrate the real-world application of demand side energy management programs – Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy sharing & further pilot project demonstration at electricity distribution company. We developed SMART AGENT: A Universal IoT-based Smart Energy Management Device – enables electricity consumers to participate in wide range of demand-side management programs – P2P energy trading, DR, etc. The Smart Agent monitors and optimizes energy usage for all flexible energy assets, making it a great fit for managing energy demands, including P2P energy trading and Demand Response programs.'
