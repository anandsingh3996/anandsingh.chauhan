Efficient task allocation among multiple robots is essential for maximizing productivity in modern warehouses, especially with the growing demands of online order fulfillment. Our project, tackles the real-time multi-robot task allocation (MRTA) problem in dynamic warehouse settings where tasks arise with specific start and end locations. The goal is to minimize the total travel distance of robots and delays in task completion, while addressing practical challenges such as battery management and collision avoidance. We proposed a dual-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework inspired by self-play, designed to optimize task assignments and robot selection, ensuring timely task execution. For safe and efficient navigation, we incorporate a modified linear quadratic controller (LQR) approach. To our knowledge, it is the first framework to comprehensively address all critical aspects of practical MRTA problems while enabling continuous robot movements.
