      During my time as part of a Department of Science and Technology (DST-India) project, titled <em>Development of a Prosumer Driven Integrated Smart Grid</em>, I contributed to the following:

      - Developed a proof of concept (PoC) and test rig at IIT Gandhinagar, demonstrating real-world applications of demand-side energy management programs like Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy sharing.
      - Showcased this work through a pilot project with an electricity distribution company.

      In addition, we developed <strong>SMART AGENT</strong>, a universal IoT-based Smart Energy Management Device that enables:

      - Participation in various demand-side management programs such as P2P energy trading and Demand Response (DR).
      - Optimized energy usage for flexible energy assets, enhancing energy management strategies.

      Our innovation, SMART AGENT, received the <em>India Smart Grid Forum (ISGF) Innovation Awards 2023 – Platinum Award</em> in the 'Smart Technology – Electricity Distribution' category.

      Furthermore, I was awarded the <em>POSOCO Power System Awards (PPSA-2021)</em> for my Master’s thesis.

      My Master’s work resulted in:
      - Two publications.
      - One patent filing.

I am a Researcher in the Decision Sciences Research Area at TCS Research, I am driven by a profound passion for applying machine learning and operational research to solve complex real-world challenges. My expertise spans diverse domains, with a particular focus on reinforcement learning and its practical applications in networked systems.

My academic journey includes an M.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar, where I developed a groundbreaking P2P energy trading testrig under the supervision of Dr. Naran Pindoriya. This project, completed in June 2020, was the first blockchain-enabled testbed in India. My work earned prestigious recognitions, including the M.Tech. Grid-India Power Systems Award, placing me among the top fifteen recipients in India, and the Platinum award from the India Smart Grid Forum (ISGF) in 2023.

At TCS Research, I collaborate with experts like Dr. Mayank Baranwal and Dr. Harshad Khadilkar to apply reinforcement learning to uncertain real-world problems. My work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical research and impactful, real-world solutions in areas such as networked systems, including power grids, transportation networks, and supply chains.
