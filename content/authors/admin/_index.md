      During my time as part of a Department of Science and Technology (DST-India) project, titled <em>Development of a Prosumer Driven Integrated Smart Grid</em>, I contributed to the following:

      - Developed a proof of concept (PoC) and test rig at IIT Gandhinagar, demonstrating real-world applications of demand-side energy management programs like Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy sharing.
      - Showcased this work through a pilot project with an electricity distribution company.

      In addition, we developed <strong>SMART AGENT</strong>, a universal IoT-based Smart Energy Management Device that enables:

      - Participation in various demand-side management programs such as P2P energy trading and Demand Response (DR).
      - Optimized energy usage for flexible energy assets, enhancing energy management strategies.

      Our innovation, SMART AGENT, received the <em>India Smart Grid Forum (ISGF) Innovation Awards 2023 – Platinum Award</em> in the 'Smart Technology – Electricity Distribution' category.

      Furthermore, I was awarded the <em>POSOCO Power System Awards (PPSA-2021)</em> for my Master’s thesis, as one of the fifteen recipients in India.

      My Master’s work resulted in two publications and one patent filing.

I am a Researcher in the Decision Sciences Research Wing at TCS Research, driven by a deep passion for leveraging machine learning and operational research to address complex, real-world challenges. My core expertise lies in reinforcement learning and machine learning, with a focus on its practical applications in networked systems.

My academic journey includes an M.Tech. in Electrical Engineering from IIT Gandhinagar, where I contributed to the Department of Science and Technology (DST India) Project on the "Development of a Prosumer Driven Integrated Smart Grid." During my time at IITGN, I played a key role in developing India's first peer-to-peer energy trading test rig, a blockchain-enabled testbed (April 2020), in collaboration with IIMA, BESS Yamuna, and Rajdhani Power. This pioneering project, completed in June 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Naran Pindoriya, led to two publications and one patent filing. My contributions were recognized with prestigious awards, including the M.Tech. Grid-India Power Systems Award and the Platinum award from the India Smart Grid Forum (ISGF) in 2023.

At TCS Research, I work closely with Dr. Mayank Baranwal and Dr. Harshad Khadilkar to explore the application of reinforcement learning to complex, uncertain environments. My research focuses on designing RL pipelines to tackle challenges in networked environments, such as power grids, transportation systems, and supply chains, with an emphasis on planning under uncertainty and adversarial conditions. Through this work, I aim to translate cutting-edge theoretical insights into impactful, real-world solutions.
